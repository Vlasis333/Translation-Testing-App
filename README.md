# Translation-testing-app
A simple application (made using VB.net and SQL DB) that lets you insert a German word with it's Greek translation. Then you can select a random word from the data base either greek or german and try to translate it (with a button for the solution). Also has diffrent group categories.

Installation:

Step 1: Download project
Step 2: Install SQL Server Express 2014 (if not installed)
Step 3: Add the .bak file to your data base (using SQL management studio)

this steps are hard coded as this application I have made it for a friend and wanted to help her with that,
and didnt make it thought code.

Step 4: Run the executable file inside the original location (DON'T MOVE FILES)

Enjoy.
